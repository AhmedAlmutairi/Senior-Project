Elementary School App:
Our elementary school app allows parents to stay engaged with their students’ academic progress throughout the school year. Parents will be provided with weekly updates about topics covered in school and the teacher’s assessment of how well the children did as a whole. The teachers can write private notices back and forth to the parent if there is an issue or challenge that a student is having. Academic progress will be able to be tracked via real-time grades, attendance, and homework assignments that have been assigned.

Events will be in available for review too, such as school assemblies, Parent Teacher Conferences, inclement weather closures/delays, emergency lockdowns / practice lockdowns, in-service / holidays, etc. These events can even be added to your calendar apps, such as on your mobile phone or Outlook, enabling easy scheduling and event conflict resolution. 

It is our desire to eliminate the gap between teacher and parent in this fast-passed society we live in today. By providing these tools, we can not only help keep parents engaged with their children, but also provide a system for teachers to easily and effectively track their learning plan for the year.

This app will leverage ASP.NET MVC, C#, SQL Server, and JavaScript technologies.

We will be implementing sorting and searching algorithms.

Our estimates are that it’s about 7 algorithms. So, it will be a challenging task.
