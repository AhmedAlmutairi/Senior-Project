Vision Statement:
The Wall:
The Wall is a collaboration tool for working with collogues locally or remotely where users can draw out diagrams, mind maps, brainstorming lists, flow charts, etc. and save them for later review. The system will show real-time updates as others draw, either using digital whiteboards, tablets, or desktop computers, and areas of the white board can be protected with the option of turning on or off overlays of others drawings or notes. This system is intended to be for both individual users and for teams who need a way to work collaboratively and have an easy way to keep track of their progress. 
Unlike A Web Whiteboard (awwapp.com), www.webwhiteboard.com, or Realtime Board (realtimeboard.com), our app will be different as there will be a section where items can be posted to the community at large, like a Stack Exchange site.

Features:
Real-time collaboration; question-answer section; private collaboration centers businesses, open source projects, and students; create diagrams, flow charts, mind maps, engineering specs, math equations, etc.

Requirements:
Easy and advanced mode;
Real-time user collaboration;
