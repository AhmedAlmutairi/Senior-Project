        <h3>About engOrg</h3>
        <p>
            We are a agile team composed of students working on the senior capstone
             for a Computer Science Major at Western Oregon University. Currently
             we have one member geographically separated from the team and recently
             added a forth member to the team demostrating our ability to adapt to
             non-ideal situations.

        <h3>Our Vision</h3>
        <p>
            myWall is a collaboration tool for working with collogues locally or
             remotely where users can draw out diagrams, mind maps, brainstorming
             lists, flow charts, etc. and save them for later review. myWall is a
             web application that allows users to connect with other users whether
             it is school, business, art, software engineering projects, the
             individuals using will be able to display their creativity with their
             very own virtual whiteboard. The system will show real-time updates
             as others draw, either using digital whiteboards or tablets, and
             areas of the white board can be protected with the option of turning
             on or off overlays of others drawings or notes. It is intended to be
             for both individual users and for teams who need a way to work
             collaboratively and have an easy way to keep track of their progress.
             Unlike A Web Whiteboard (awwapp.com), www.webwhiteboard.com, or
             Realtime Board (realtimeboard.com). Our app will be different as
             there will be a section where items can be posted to the community
             at large, like a Stack Exchange site.
