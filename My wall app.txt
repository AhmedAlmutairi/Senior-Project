We need to use asp.net MVC5, C#, SQL server, LINQ pad. So, we won’t use any tools that not covered in the class.
We will use sorting algorithms and search algorithms since the user need to be able to search for some posts or profiles.
We think that it’s about 6. So, it is about the average of difficulty to be done.
